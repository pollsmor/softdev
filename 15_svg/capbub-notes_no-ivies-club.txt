K15 -- Event Propagation Observations
2020-04-01

v1
Predictions:
- The text inside the cells will appear as a popup when you click on one of them
- After a few times clicking it Firefox will ask me if I want the website to stop making more popups

Observations:
- First prediction was correct
- It only took 2 clicks for the checkbox to prevent additional dialogs to appear

Anything else:
- What if I accidentally ticked that checkbox? It's a necessary part of the website. How can I "untick" it?
  (besides deleting all the data in the browser, that is)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2
Predictions:
- Considering the words "bubble up" I'm inclined to believe that the "childest" child alerts first.
- Alerts wait for one another, the second alert doesn't appear until the first is dismissed.
- So if I click "Yoda", I should get alerted "Yoda", then "Yoda Luke Obi-Wan", then the entire table.

Observations:
- First prediction was correct
- I didn't expect the <td> tags to also be included in the second alert though
- I also thought that the outermost element would be <table>, not <tbody>.

Anything else:
- I didn't even notice that the table was actually index 0 until opening it in the browser
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v3
Predictions:
- According to analysis in the anything else section, the table is triggered first, then the <td>, then the <tr>.
- I actually used stopPropagation() in a previous assignment. It should make it so that once the table alerts,
  it is stopped dead in its tracks. The td and tr don't give out alerts at all.

Observations:
- Indeed went <tbody>, <td>, <tr>
- stopPropagation() did work as expected

Anything else:
- true is the third element for addEventListener
- According to my research on the MDN, this corresponds to the "capture" argument,
  which means it gets triggered before its children does (basically )
