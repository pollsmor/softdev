notes:
(+) Parts of the website are very nicely broken down, easy to navigate
(-) The number of deaths for the states gets harder and harder to see the darker the shade of red
    Black text with white outline?
(*) Great team name!

notes:
(+) Very high effort intro imo
(+) I like the example countries picked for the demo, shows how useful the website is for analysis of the pandemic
(-) No offense, but the last 45 seconds feels like just a way to bring the video length up, not much insight gained from a montage
(*) The economic impact feature just seems like a weird tack-on,
    but not (-) since it's better than nothing
===========================================================

notes:
(+) Big props for taking the effort to coordinate a call while recording your demo
(-) Don't get the point of the COVID parameters section
(-) May just be personal preference, but I don't really like the white on black color scheme of the graph.
(*) Short and sweet

notes:
(+) The ethnicity bar chart is so cool...
(+) I like the color schemes picked, but darker colors = hard to see black text, white outline?
(+) Interface is fun and easy to navigate through (sans one negative below)
(-) Would prefer some audio adjustments so that everyone's volume sounds close to uniform.
(-) I'd replace "fratio" and "mratio" with just "Female" and "Male".
(-) I feel like the state search feature would be better as a dropdown - there's only 50 elements to pick from.
(*) I think that the lists could be prettier using Bootstrap styling
(*) All rights reserved?
(*) Wow our female to male ratio

notes:
(+) Density of information (a lot in very little time shown)
(-) Don't really enjoy the color schemes used
(-) The alert and memes don't really contribute anything to the site
(-) Wish there was more commentary to tell me what to look at on the screen
(-) Only a single person talking
(*) Tempurature --> Temperature
(*) Protip: Shift + Command + 5 on a Mac for easy screen recording!
(*) All hail the Empire! Or the First Order. idk.

notes:
(+) Very high effort intro
(+) Coordinating a call while recording the demo is always a +1
(+) 3D, wow. That globe is a very neat and intuitive feature.
(+) Good asynchronous search feature
(-) Would like brief explainers for what each part of the website is for.
    Just a title isn't enough imo.
(-) You can rotate axis labels so that the Y-axis label follows the axis's direction
(-) Not really sure about showing off actual code. Doesn't feel essential to the
    demo.
(*) Who disliked this video?
(*) My left ear...just overall sound issues throughout
(*) Have you guys registered with the U.S. copyright office?

notes:
(+) Being able to create, save, and share your own case study is rather neat.
(+) A lot of data to pick and choose from
(-) I'd prefer if you focused on one aspect/dataset of the graph rather than go through
    each of them one by one with 1 second of interlude between them
(-) More uniform volume in the demo would be nice
(-) The forms look kind of outdated in design
(*) The "mood" of the demo goes from 0 to 100
(*) What's stopping me from creating a study with every single possible graph?
(*) You're welcome

notes:
(+) I like the use of the heat maps
(+) The virus simulation feature is really cool
(-) The hovering feature takes a bit too long to activate
(-) Color scheme (orange on paper yellow) isn't that good imo
(-) Don't really see the point of making the user wait 3 seconds to see the number
    tick up to 4261747 if it's always that number
(*) 4261747 global cases up to date...as of?
(*) U.S. copyright office reporting in

notes:
(+) The spider chart looks really cool.
(-) The countries bar chart is way too hard to see, would prefer a horizontal bar chart rather than vertical
(-) The factor data graph is way too smushed, bad allocation of space

(-) Overall interface of the website could do with some polishing
(-) Single person presenting
(*) Nah, North Korea is the happiness country on Earth.
(*) Is the spider chart a jOjO rEfErEnCe?
(*) Â©

team: I am not ok with this

notes:
(+) A lot of personality on this team
(+) Very responsive and fluid site interface
(-) Website feels more like a proof of concept than something I'd use to identify trends in data.
(-) High learning curve to use site
(*) I hate how iMovie stretches the video and cuts off the left and right by default.
    Easy to tell when a video has been edited with it because of this.

(+) Whoa how did you guys do that spiral graph?
(+) Providing both a dropdown and search for countries is pretty neat.
(+) I like the country comparison feature.
(-) I would split the various graphs into separate pages/subpages. 5 graphs on one screen
    that have little to do with one another is a lot to take in.
(-) A bit too in depth into the code used imo
(*) Hi Ethan!

notes:
(+) *Very* high effort intro, funniest so far (and the coordination!)
    This is the kind of video length padding that I'm 100% ok with
(-) Poor use of space for the pie charts
(-) Looking at Visual Studio for a minute is rather boring.
(*) Either one of the laptop's fans are running at 10000rpm, or the mic has a
    really horrible noise gate
(*) Junhee out here with a professional mic

notes:
(+) Cool animation for the "scatter" plot
(+) A lot of datasets to pick from
(-) Start page looks kinda unpolished, hate having to read a paragraph
(-) Interface of the site seems kind of confusing to navigate,
    feels like separate sites rather than a single connected site
(-) Last speaker is kinda quiet, would prefer that clip's volume to be boosted
(*) Over 6 minutes

(+) Coordinated call demo! Nice globe at the end there.
(+) That is a really cool title card.
(+) Really like the highlight selection feature and how specific you can get
(+) Easy comparing of CO2 emissions and global temperatures
(-) Graph titles are off center (sorry can't find anything "bad"!)
(*) Grade A blurring of whoever was in the background in the top right.
