------NOTES------
Dreams
- Have specific dreams: zero gravity vs being an astronaut
  - I'm not sure about this. Isn't something like that wayyyy too specific? 
- Brick walls let us prove how badly we want things
  - This was parroted multiple times throughout the lecture and I totally agree.
- You can get a lot from the dreams you don't accomplish
- You have to get the fundamentals down
- "When you're screwing up and no one's saying anything anymore, that means they gave up"
  - I need to keep this in mind. 
- "Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted"
- "Give them a little more time and they'll impress you"
  - I don't agree with this. I'll definitely keep this in mind but I won't wait for someone to impress me forever.
- Get out of pissing matches as soon as possible
  - Hope I never get into them.

Helping others achieve their dreams
- Encourage everyone to do better, only doing people a disservice by setting a bar anywhere
  - Never thought about things this way before. Sometimes holding back praise can help people do even greater things!
- Give people the chance to show others their talents
- Find someone better than you to hand off your project to
- Get someone to become self-reflective

Pieces of advice
- Mentors are extremely important
- Never lose child-like wonder
- Help others
- Never give up
- You can't get places alone - get people to help you by telling the truth, apologize when you screw up, and focus on others
  - This is something I'm afraid I'm gonna struggle with in the future. I prefer being alone. But I know I am limiting my potential by doing so. 
- Don't bail on your dreams
- Cherish and use feedback
- Show gratitude
  - I often do this indirectly, without outright just saying the words "thank you" to people. Is this bad? 
- Don't complain - work harder
  - Not too sure about this advice. 
- Be good at something - gives you a value
  - It's just, there's more than 7 billion people in the world. Can I really make myself irreplaceable? 
- People will show you their good side - keep waiting, everyone has a good side.
  - Again, I'm not too sure about this piece of advice. 
- "Luck is where preparation meets opportunity"
  - I first encountered this piece of advice when playing Tetris actually. When I first got into Tetris, I thought that the
    good players were just getting extremely lucky. But no, the reason it seems so is because they're always in position
    for good RNG to benefit them. I will definitely make sure to always be prepared for any lucky opportunities that might pop up.
