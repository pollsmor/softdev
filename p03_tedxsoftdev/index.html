        <p class="lead">A toolkit by Google for building applications that work on mobile,
                        web, and desktop, from a single codebase.</p>

          <li>You have no need of creating/maintaining separate versions of your apps for iPhones or Android devices!</li>
          <li>Version 1.0 was released back in December 2018 (it is currently on 1.12)</li>

        <h1 class="display-4">What sets Flutter apart?</h1>
        <p class="lead">Performance</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Compiles to native code for a platform so performance is barely impacted</li>
          <li>Alternative frameworks give up performance in some way (i.e. React Native uses
              a JavaScript bridge and Ionic uses web elements)</li>
        </ul>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">Hot Reload</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changes you make to your code get pushed to the device instantly (< 1 second)</li>
          <li>No need to compile the program over and over, speeds up development</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="jumbotron">
        <h1 class="display-4">Structure of a Flutter program</h1>
        <p class="lead">A Flutter program is a tree of widgets. Everything is a widget in Flutter:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Center (does it according to its parent widget)</li>
          <li>Text</li>
          <li>Row/column (laying elements left to right or top to bottom, respectively)</li>
          <li>Container (can wrap another widget inside it, allowing you to apply styling to it such as color)</li>
          <li>Much more, because you're not limited to the provided ones - you can easily download user-created widgets from the web!</li>
        </ul>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">A widget can be "stateless" or "stateful" depending on if you want it to update
                        for some reason (e.g. liking a tweet)</p>
        <p>Flutter is smart enough to only redraw widgets you want to update - it doesn't
           refresh the entire page, leading to high performance.</p>

      <div class="jumbotron">
        <h1 class="display-4">Want to code using Flutter?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>The IDE of choice is Android Studio, as it supports a Flutter plugin</li>
          <li>You may choose to deploy to a physical iOS/Android device or an iOS simulator/Android emulator</li>
          <li><a href="https://dartpad.dev">https://dartpad.dev</a>is a great way to test out code without having to install anything!</li>

        <h1 class="display-4">How about something more complicated?</h1>
        <p class="lead">Here is an app I've been working on in my free time running on both Android/iOS:</p>

        <p class="lead">Flutter adapts to your platform.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>By and large the apps look about the same.</li>
          <li>The same code, but platform differences are still applied: e.g.
              the title of the page is centered on iOS and left-aligned on Android</li>
          <li>Similar case with scrolling behavior</li>

        <h1 class="display-4">How is this related to the class?</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>This isn't Windows SoftDev, macOS SoftDev, or Linux SoftDev.</li>
          <li>Flutter accomplishes similar goals in that it works across platforms, like the web does.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">Learning to design user interfaces, not just crunch numbers and run algorithms</p>
