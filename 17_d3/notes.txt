K17: Deeper into D3
2020-04-06

2. By Example
Notes/observations
- Change stuff and seeing what happens is good, fast learning
- The import examples have a default set of data that is used if you don't specify
  any/type something wrong (i.e. the histogram defaults to unemployment % and county)
- Being able to lazily load more of the array is cool (.. more)
  - Probably a performance optimization to not have to load 1000000 things at once
- Okay setting the height as 0 was a bad idea
- Me: invalid module shows up a an error when the d3 version is too low (2 in this case)
  - No median feature back then?
- Can add our own lines of code and pin them, and even comment on them


Questions
- Is the number for the height the absolute amount of pixels the histogram takes up?
- - Why do seemingly the same things appear twice? (the top one is uneditable)
- Curious about the power usage to the client device of the chart3 example (slider)
