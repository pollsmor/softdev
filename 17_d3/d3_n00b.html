<!--D3 demo: hardcoded bars removed, to be generated fr data-->
<!--
    Can yield a horizontal bar chart if properly bound to data
    (steelblue bars, white number overlays)
    ...but will yield only blank page at first.

<style>
  .chart div {
  font: 10px sans-serif;
  background-color: steelblue;
  text-align: right;
  padding: 3px;

<!--------------------------------
    Entering the following commands via console will
    incrementally re-create your hardcoded chart...
    //Init your data:
    var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];
    //Select your chart.
    var chart = d3.select(".chart");
    //Prepare for data join.
    var bar = chart.selectAll("div");
    (this defines selection to which you will join data)
    //Join your data.
    var barUpdate = bar.data(data);
    //Instantiate new elements by appending to the “enter selection.”
    var barEnter = barUpdate.enter().append("div");
    //Set width of each bar proportional to its data value.
    barEnter.style("width", function(d) {
    return d * 10 + "px"; });
    //Label each bar.
    barEnter.text(function(d) { return d; });

    Notes
    Predictions
    - Initial load of the page is empty until commented commands are run in dev console
    - First sign of things happening on the page is from running the .enter().append("div") command,
      but every bar will be really small and take up the same amount of space

    Observations
    - Forgot that the default behavior of a div is to take up the whole width of its row
    - Otherwise, pretty expected behavior

    Others
    - The chart variable is just an empty div. What's the point of running .selectAll() on chart?
    - Kinda confused as to what the .data() and .enter() functions do


    Enhanced notes
    - console.log(data)
      - Returns the array as defined
    - console.log(chart)
      - Returns a Pt (whatever that is) that contains two key-value pairs: _groups to an Array,
        and _parents to some HTML
      - Makes sense that it has none of the data from the defined array yet since they're
        not joined together yet
    - console.log(bar)
      - Also returns a Pt, but this time _groups corresponds to a NodeList
        and _parents to <div class="chart">
    - console.log(barUpdate)
      - Now the Pt has a _enter, _exit_ and _groups array.
      - The _groups array is 6 large so I thought it would contain the 6 numbers
        in the array we defined earlier, but it seems to be empty.
    - console.log(barEnter)
      - The _groups array is no longer empty, but it just contains 6 empty divs.
        Have yet to see any actual numbesr in place of them.
      - The _enter and _exit arrays have disappeared. It's rather clean atm.
    - The barEnter.style() command automatically returned something, no console.log() required.
      - The previous commands were setting a variable to something, not returning.
      - If I *do* console.log() it though, it prints itself and returns undefined.
      - Whoa. Now the divs contain the specified widths from the defined array. Where does the
        "d" variable in function(d) originate from? Seems to come out of nowhere.
      - The _parents and _groups array contain the same thing now? 6 divs styled to the correct width.
    - barEnter.text()
      - Oh wait, d is just what's between the two div tags. My web console just automatically
        puts in ellipses so I don't see the actual data. I do though if I copy it as HTML.
      - That explains where function(d) comes from. It doesn't come from thin air.
      - bar.data(data) is where the data is initially inserted into the divs. It was a bunch of ellipses
        so I initially overlooked it.
